**Summarize the key points from the papers**

(1) The considered *network type* varies across papers

ex) vehicular networks and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) systems, molecular structures..etc..

(2) What is the *system model*?

ex)The system models comprise different numbers of nodes with distinct configurations.

 (3) *The purpose* of incorporating "the concept" in these models is to address specific physical implications.

ex of "the concept") fairness.

 (4) The *optimization objective*s involve maximizing, minimizing, or optimizing certain aspects. The objective functions vary across papers.

 (5) The *controlling variables* differ, influencing the outcomes of the models.

 (6) *Various constraints* are present, including those related to computing models.
